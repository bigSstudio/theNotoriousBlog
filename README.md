## Summary

Based on given input, I've created a simple, minimalistic design for a lifestyle blog. All requirements are successfully implemented.
* The blog is inspired by underground, mostly hip-hop culture of the New York City. The whole design is based on it having roots back in the '90s, all the way to present day. The name is inspired by the NYC legend "The Notorious B.I.G".
* Fonts used are Playfair Display, a nice, serif font, and San Francisco Pro, clean and sans-serif font, most comonly found as a system font in MacOS. Both fonts were downloaded, extracted and pulled into project as any other Google font, with exception of SF Pro, that has a local parameter, which helps Mac users to load it from the system. Font sizes, letter spacing and text shadows are mostly according to Material design guidelines.
* Color scheme is taken from a Brooklyn-born designer, which he created and got awarded for. He got the inspiration from watching sunset in his neighbourhood. What I did is, took his palette and made it look more pastel, to suit a fashion/lifestyle blog more.
* Images were downloaded from Unsplash.com
* Icons come from my personal collection.
* Tools used: Adobe Xd, Visual Studio Code, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave Browser, Mozilla Dev Edition, Vivaldi browser.
* HTML is written as HTML5, using suitable semantic elemets, and validated in W3C validator with 0 errors and 0 warnings.
* CSS is written in SCSS and compiled using VS Code Sass compile plugin. Folder structure is a so-called 7-1 structure. Occasionally, I've used BEM principles for modifying sizes and layout order. 
* Cards were made based on Material design guidelines (shadows, border radius, sizing, spacing, hover effects).
* Images were optimized in Photoshop, saved as progressive JPEG with 60% compression and further striped down using a CSS filter hack, as described here: https://css-tricks.com/contrast-swap-technique-improved-image-performance-css-filters/
* All interactions were created using jQuery.
* Webiste is fully responsive and tested on screens from 320px to 4K.
* Everything inside this folder is created from scratch.
* One thing that's not on the list is shrinking navbar on scroll.

* 2K+ lines of code
* 2.5 work days
* Xd design + code

For any questions regarding the design, the code or the process, feel free to ask.
Happy review!
